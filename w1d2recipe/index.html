<!-- ASSIGNMENT STATUS REPORT 1/15/2020 Murad Hajiyev
Dear Professor,  I have successfully completed my assignment and below is the link to my github pages website
https://muradhajiyev.github.io/

First of all, I want to mention that I had done this lab yesterday in time before the deadline.
But I had submitted to the previous lab (w1d1) mistakenly. I hope you will consider it.
Additionally, Thank you for this practical assignment that helped me learn a lot of Html and CSS features
which I have never used. I completed the homework for today; It took me about 3 hours

• Creating a page from scratch by looking at a picture was a great practical assignment for me.  I learned a lot of new Html and CSS features.
  Such as: <del>, <pre> and reversing ordered list, etc.
• The lab was completed. in About page validator, there are some errors but these errors belong to the official bootstrap.css file.

Completed additional 2 features are:
    1. Background image
    2. Favicon

        This is a very fun recipe to follow, because Grandma makes it sweet and simple. This pie is thickened with cornstarch and flour in addition to egg yolks, and contains no milk.
